# Meet Amit!

I am a Mumbai native who crossed the big blue ocean to chase my MBA dreams in the USA. When I am not busy finding solutions and delivering products, I'm busy being a dad to two darling girls and taking in all the furry creatures that need a home. In fact, my family has had so many foster animals that the house is beginning to resemble a zoo! But that's how I roll - I am always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need, whether they bark, meow, or chuckle.
